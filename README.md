# Java-Crash-Course
This is basically code from a 12 hour java crash course that covers about 40-50% of things you need to know for development in java.

You have the right to distribute, remix, and download any form of this code. After all, I learned this code from a youtube crash course. Shout out to @Bro Codez:
